0,What am I losing when using extension tubes instead of a macro lens?,"After playing around with macro photography on-the-cheap (read: reversed lens, rev. lens mounted on a straight lens, passive extension tubes), I would like to get further with this. The problems with the techniques I used is that focus is manual and aperture control is problematic at best. This limited my setup to still subjects (read: dead insects) Now, as spring is approaching, I want to be able to shoot live insects. I believe that for this, autofocus and settable aperture will be of great help.

So, one obvious but expensive option is a macro lens (say, EF 100mm Macro) However, I am not really interested in yet another prime lens. An alternative is the electrical extension tubes.

Except for maximum focusing distance, what am I losing when using tubes (coupled with a fine lens, say EF70-200/2.8) instead of a macro lens?
",ysap,https://photo.stackexchange.com/users/1024,"I just got extension tubes, so here's the skinny.


  ...what am I losing when using tubes...?


A very considerable amount of light!  Increasing that distance from the end of the lens to the sensor can cut your light several stops.  Combined with the fact that you'll usually shoot stopped down - expect to need to increase your ISO considerably.

The fact the macro's are usually considered very very sharp, although I believe that 70-200mm 2.8 is supposed to be quite sharp.

The ultra low distortion typical of many macros.

I wouldn't worry too much about the bokeh since the DOF will still be quite limited.

Coupled on my 50mm, a full 60mm'ish extension tube results in a DOF of about a couple inches in front of the lens.  On my 70-300, its probably around 2-3 feet in front of the lens to about a foot in front of the lens.

1,What is the distinction between a city and a sprawl/metroplex... between downtown and a commercial district?,"I am trying to understand what kinds of places the spam values on p 231 refer to in the 5th Edition main book for Shadowrun.

Per p 15, a sprawl is a plex, a plex is a ""metropolitan complex, short for metroplex"". Per Google a metroplex is "" a very large metropolitan area, especially one that is an aggregation of two or more cities"".  A city downtown and sprawl downtown would tend to have similar densities, but for some reason the sprawl (which includes suburbs?) has a higher spam zone noise rating (p 231).  Similarly, I'd think of a downtown as being more dense and noisy (e.g. Office buildings and street vendors) than a commercial district, e.g. an outdoor mall.  The noise ratings make me think that I am thinking about this incorrectly. What is a better way of thinking of them?

(p.216) spam zone: An area flooded with invasive and/or viral AR advertising, causing noise.

2,Maximum protusion length for through-hole component pins,"I'm working on a PCB that has through-hole components on both sides of the board. The ""top"" side of the board is mounted flush to a Delrin plastic block (the only top-side component is a gas sensor that is fed air samples through hose fittings in the plastic block).

The flush mounting means that I have to add grooves to the plastic block to accommodate the soldered pins of the bottom-side components. Assuming a standard 0.062"" thickness FR4 board, how deep do I need to make the grooves in the plastic block? The only thing I could find is this NASA workmanship standard that states 0.5mm to 2.29mm, but I'm not sure if that will always hold true.
",Joe Baker,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/10157,"Do you even need grooves?  We make several products using through-hole components that are intended to mount using VHB double-sided foam tape.  The boards are 0.062"" thick double-sided with PTH and we use a table-top vertical belt sander to bring the component leads almost flush with the solder mask.  In other words, the solder mask isn't touched by the sand paper but the leads are all sanded flat and sitting just proud of the solder mask.

This works well for small boards.

For what it's worth, there are commercial machines available that use a rotary saw blade to do the same thing.  The board is held horizontal in a mounting / clamping system on the base and the saw motor is vertical on a sliding X-Y mechanism.  The saw blade simply cuts all of the leads almost flush with the board surface.  

This system is suited for boards of all sizes but especially for those boards larger than can be handled easily to be sanded with the belt sander.

Also note that these techniques are suitable only for PC boards with plated-through holes.

Indeed the limit is changed.
However, when I open another terminal and check the value, I still see zero value in core file size.

Questions:


Are changes made using ulimit command affect only current process, i.e. in this case the bash?
I launch a program from shell as a fore- or-background process. Does the ulimit change apply for new process ?
How can I make that all user processes are affected with this configuration ?

15,sleeping SPID blocking other transactions,"I'm really having trouble tracking down some blocking we are experiencing.

The root blocking SPID's status is 'sleeping', the cmd is 'AWAITING COMMAND', and the sqltext is 'SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED'.

When I view the Top Transactions by Blocked Transactions Count report, the Blocking SQL Statement is '--'.

I've performed a trace on the SQL and when the blocking happens tracing the root blocking SPID but it hasn't really led me anywhere.  The last trace statement is the same as the sqltext above 'SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED'.

I've checked all the related SPROCs I can find to make sure they have TRY/CATCH BEGIN TRAN/COMMIT TRAN/ROLLBACK TRAN statements (we use SPROCs for everything so there are no standalone statements being ran).  This issue just started happening over the last 24 hours and no one is claiming to have made any changes to the system.

Solution.  One of our seldomly used SPROCs had an error with an insert (number of columns didn't match), but we are still confused on what exactly was happening.

When looking at all the trace information, the EXEC statement for this SPROC was listed at times, but NEVER just before the BLOCK happened on the blockking SPID.  It seemed that when it starting blocking, the trace didn't record the execution of it (or any of the statements within it either).  However there are other times were the trace did record it's execution and no blocking occurred.

The SPROC error report came from a user, and I was able to find multiple EXEC statements in traces and run them in SSMS.  No time when I ran them did we have any blocking occur or did they hang.  They ran as expected (the catch block fired and rolled back the transaction after the error).  After resolving the fixing the SPROC, we have not seen the issue again.

17,"what's the relation between sensor size and image quality (noise, dynamic range)?","I'm reading this description on sensor size:


  Digital compact cameras have substantially smaller sensors offering a
  similar number of pixels. As a consequence, the pixels are much
  smaller, which is a key reason for the image quality difference,
  especially in terms of noise and dynamic range.


Could you please elaborate on the last sentence: what's the relation between sensor size and image quality? In particular, what are the advantages and disadvantages of a small sensor (of a compact camera, in contrast to a large sensor of a DSLR camera)?
",cody,https://photo.stackexchange.com/users/11005,"A digital image sensor is ultimately a device that uses the photovoltaic or photoconductive properties of photodiodes to convert photons into electrons (charge), which can later be read out as a saturation value and converted to a digital pixel. This is an analog-to-analog then analog-to-digital conversion process. 

The key behavior of a photodiode relevant to imaging, converting photons to electrons, improves with total surface area. The more surface area, the greater the area to detect photon strikes per photodiode, and the greater the physical material area within which electron charge (signal) can be collected. In other words, larger physical pixel area equates to higher signal ratio. The ""depth"" of a well is ultimately immaterial to modern Bayer-type CFA sensors, as deeper penetration only really has a filtration effect...the deeper a photon penetrates a photodiode, the more blueshifted light will be filtered out in favor of redshifted light. This is due to the response curve of the type of silicon used in photodiodes...which are more sensitive to infrared wavelengths than visible light wavelengths, and more sensitive to visible light wavelengths than ultraviolet and x-ray wavelengths.

Finally, being electronic devices, image sensors produce a variety of forms of electronic noise. In particular, they are susceptible to a low number of electrons in any given photodiode being generated from the low level of dark current that is always running through the sensor. Being devices sensitive to electromagnetic frequencies, the intrinsic field of the sensor itself can be affected by strong, nearby devices that emit electromagnetic frequencies of their own (if its not shielded properly) which can produce banding. Slight differences in the exact electrical response of each pixel can produce slight variations in how the charge accumulated in a photodiode is read out, and there can be thermally induced forms of noise. These forms of noise create a signal floor wherein it becomes difficult or impossible to determine of a digital pixel level is the product of an actual photon capture or due to electronic and thermal noise. So long as the image signal is larger than the noise floor, or in other words the signal to noise ratio (SNR) is high, a useful image can be produced.

All things being equal...and by that, I mean the same number of pixels, the same ultimate sensor design characteristics, the same amount of dark current, the same amount of read noise...a smaller sensor will be noisier than a larger sensor because the larger sensor, with the exact same number of pixels, can have larger surface area for each of those pixels, allowing more electrons to be captured for any given photon strike. A larger pixel has a higher maximum saturation point, which allows more total electron charge before the pixel is ""full"" or totally white. That intrinsically increases SNR, reducing the impact that electronic noise has on the final image signal, producing less noisy images at exactly the same settings as a smaller sensor.

Dynamic range is the total usable tonal range available from a sensor. It is ultimately affected by the amount of electronic noise present in a sensor and the maximum saturation point of the pixels, or the ratio between the mean of electronic noise and the maximum saturation point of each pixel in the sensor. Again, all things being equal, dynamic range will be better on a larger sensor as the SNR, even at low signal levels, is going to be slightly better than a smaller sensor, and at higher signal levels it can be significantly better. As is often the case with image sensors these days, increasing pixel size, or for that matter increasing a pixels maximum sensitivity (ISO), has the effect of also increasing the maximum amount of read noise at low ISO. This is ultimately due to poor control over electronic noise to start with, resulting in higher read noise at minimum ISO for larger sensors than for smaller sensors. While the increase in read noise is often still minor compared to the increase in maximum saturation point, and therefor does not affect maximum SNR much, it can mitigate or eliminate any gains at the sensors minimal SNR level, reducing or eliminating any improvement in dynamic range as well.

Or in other words, is it better to HKDF-extract on a longer IKM string and use multiple HKDF-expands, or is it better to use HKDF on independent but shorter IKMs.

My intuition tells me that, if my randomness strings are really as good as I claim, then two independent HKDF extracts are better, but using a single one on the concatenation is, in practice, just as safe, and safer if my input randomness is not actually as good as assumed, so two HKDFs might be more robust in practice.

As Zak stated, you could use exposure compensation to darken the entire image (this might make the non-sky portion of the image too dark though)
Use a graduated neutral density filter. This will selectively darken one part of an image while leaving the other part alone. This is the old-school method. While it typically limits the transition between the filtered and unfiltered parts to a straight line, it does allow you to fix things at the time of the shot without having to spend time tweaking it on the computer afterwards.

",verve,https://travel.stackexchange.com/users/2283,"TL;DR - Depends, on your pre-paid card, the hotel, and how you book the hotel.

There are a few different charges to consider here:


Pre-payment of the room at/shortly after booking
Holding the room on a flexible booking
Deposit at checkin
Room charge, meals, drinks, extras etc at checkout


With many OTAs and hotel websites, if you make a non flexible booking, or some kinds of flexible bookings, they will charge your card for the room rate during the booking process. With some others, they'll send your card details through to the hotel, who'll put it through their tills later. (Maybe that day, maybe during a weekly sweep). In order for this pre-payment to go through, your card will need to support offline / cardholder-not-present transactions. As long as your card advertises itself as ""suitable for online shopping"" or similar, and as long as the card issuer doesn't block travel booking, you should be fine. Speak to your card issuer to be sure.

Alternately, when reserving the room, you might opt for a flexible rate where you pay at checkout, with no pre-payment. This is typically offered on the hotel's own site, and some OTAs. They will normally ask for a credit card to ""hold"" the reservation, which would be charged in the event of a no-show, but as long as you turn up as planned the card won't be charged. These rates are normally a bit more expensive than non-flexible pre-paid ones, but this style of booking should be fine on any card.

At checkin, most hotels (but not all) will want to take some sort of deposit. Typically this covers any unpaid parts of the room rate, along with expected spend in the restaurant / bar / etc. The details taken would also be used in the event of damage. If you've pre-paid the room and don't plan to run up extras in the hotel, many hotels would let you not leave a deposit, but not all. Very small hotels may take a look at you, decide you look fine, and tell you to pay everything at checkout. Some hotels may want to take something no matter what.

For the deposit, this is normally done as a pre-authorisation. Not all pre-paid card support this, which would be a problem. Some pre-paid cards do support it, but badly, and might take a week or so to release the reserved funds, which could be a problem. Check with your card issuer about this. Alternately, many hotels which require a deposit will be willing to take a cash deposit, but they may well want a larger cash deposit than they'd normally authorise on a credit card. (They can't charge extras to the card later for example). Expect to leave a hefty chunk of cash as a deposit, expect checkin to take a while, expect several people to count the money, bills may be checked for counterfeits, and expect a receipt at the end. Speak with the hotel first to see if they need a deposit, and if they take cash ones. As a datapoint, I once got stuck in a checkin queue behind someone doing a cash deposit, he was asked to leave something like 4 nights room rate as a deposit on a 2 night stay.

Finally, we have settling up the bill at the end. If you pre-paid, and didn't eat there, you could well find there's nothing to pay, or just a few dollars / pounds / euros in city taxes. Alternately, if you didn't pre pay (or they didn't take it), ate in the restaurant lots etc, you could have a decent amount to pay here. You'll be present, so any card which supports in-person transactions will be fine for this. Well, as long as you have the money on it for the bill that is! If you did a cash deposit, you should get the choice between taking the bill off that and getting the remainder, or getting the whole deposit back in cash and paying on a card.

Oh, one more possibility - charges not noticed at checkout. Maybe you forgot to tell them about the minibar charges, maybe that morning's breakfast didn't go through, something like that. If you used a credit card for the deposit, expect them to charge it to that later when they notice. If you paid cash, expect to get a bill in the mail some time later.

Can it be done - sure! Can it be done at one specific hotel with one particular kind of pre-paid card on one specific rate booked one specific way? Depends...

24,Fiber Channel SAN hooked up to 2 ESXi Hosts,"I have a PowerVault with 4 FC modules at 8gb/s. I don't want to jack the SAN into our 10/100/1000 switch because of the max 1gb/s speed.

My question is can I jack both ESXi host's FC into the SAN's FCs and have HV and vMotion?
",Frank,https://serverfault.com/users/95480,"The SAN itself doesn't need an Ethernet connection in this case, all it needs is FC to the ESXi hosts. The ESXi hosts will need GigE Ethernet. During VMotion, the source ESXi starts sending machine-state to the target ESXi host over the VMKernel connection in the virtual-switch. That's actually a connection between the two ESXi hosts over your physical Ethernet switch. Meanwhile, when state is fully transferred control of the VMDK files is passed over to the target server it it goes live. So, vMotion requires both FC and Ethernet.

HA (what I presume you meant by HV) requires vMotion to work, so should be available if vMotion is working. 

Unless you meant Hardware Virtualization, or direct LUN presentation. That can also work, but is trickier. The same volume needs to be presented to both ESXi hosts using exactly the same LUN number, if it doesn't have the same LUN number that volume won't be visible when the VM is on one or the other ESXi host.

29,Does this statement make any sense?,"I am asking this question completely out of curiosity. The other day, my roommate, by mistake, used 'Light year' as a unit of time instead of distance. When I corrected him (pedantic, much), he said the following:

""Units are relative. And according to Fourier Transforms, units can be changed so Light year is a unit of time.""

That got me thinking and I read up Fourier Transforms on wikipedia but couldn't find anything about using a unit in one domain as a unit for another measurement. I do agree that units (particularly, base units are relative. eg: the meter), but does his statement make any sense?

EDIT
Thank you everyone for all the answers. It isn't so much to in it in or prove a point as it is to understand the concept better. Anyways this is his response after I showed him this thread. Any comments would be appreciated.

His response:
Nevermind, for the first time I accept I was wrong. BUT using lightyears to measure time is possible. My example didn't make sense bacause I was wrong when I meantioned that I'm still measuring dist. If you have a signal in time domain and ...take the FT, I get a signal which DOES NOT HAVE to be in frequency domain. Clarify this to the guy who posted last. Now the new signal is in a domain defined by me and so is its units. This signal although not equal to the original signal, still represents that if ya take an inverse FT. So, the idea of time will still be there. Now coming back to our case: lightyears here is not the lightyears you are used to read when dealing with distance. It represents time.
",xbonez,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/436,"This doesn't make much sense: light year is in any case a unit of distance.

What is common is to use ""reduced units"", for examples units where $c=1$ (speed of light) or $h=2\pi$. But in these cases the opposite would happen: you would say ""year"" to mean a distance. Or for example you say ""has a mass of xyz MeV"" instead of ""$MeV/c^2$"".



About the Fourier transform: this allow to go from the so-called ""time domain"" (even if ""time"" is not always the usual time) to the ""frequency domain"" involving ... frequencies.

But as you can see this cannot change the definition of light-year.

30,"2 servers, high availability and faster response","I recently bought a second webserver because I worry about hardware failure of my old server. Now that I have that second server I wish to do a little more then just have one server standby and replicate all day. As long as it's there I might as well get some advantage our of it !

I have a website powered by ubuntu 12.04, nginx, php-fpm, apc, mysql (5.5) and couchdb.

Im currently testing configurations where i can achieve failover AND make good use of the extra harware for faster responses / distributed load.

The setup I am testing nowinvolves heartbeat for ip failover and two identical servers. Of the two servers only one has a public ip adress. If one server crashes the other server takes over the public ip adress. On an incoming request nginx forwards the request tot php-fpm to either server a of server b (50/50 if both servers are alive). Once the request has been send to php-fpm both servers look at localhost for the mysql server. I use master-master mysql replication for this. The file system is synced with lsyncd.

This works pretty well but Im reading it's discouraged by the (mysql) community.

Another option I could think of is to use one server as a mysql master and one server as a web/php server. The servers would still sync their filesystem, would still run the same duplicate software (nginx,mysql) but master slave mysql replication could be used. As long as bother servers are alive I could just prefer nginx to listen to ip a and mysql to ip b. If one server is down, the other server could take over the task of the other server, simply by ip switching. 

But im completely new at this so I would greatly value your expert advice. Is either of the two setups any good ? If you have any thoughts on this please let me know !

PS, virtualisation, hosting on different locations or active/passive setups are not solutions im looking for. I find virtual server either too slow or too expensive. I already have a passive failover on another location. But in case of a crash I found the site was still unreachable for too long due to dns caching.

But as always, we advise not trying to do this unless you have substantial experience, as you are more likely to end up with a more unreliable configuration, that is harder to debug and if you end up in a split brain situation, more likely to have data loss ... than a plain old single server.

So, we have a non-peturbative definition of M-theory and string theories on AdS Space through the AdS/.CFT correspondence. Now,  these are 10 or 11-dimensional.          To get rid of the extra 6 or 7 dimensions, you need to compactify it on a 6-dimensional or 7-dimensional manifold. 

A particularly convinient compactifications of 11-dimensional M-theory is on $G(2)$-holonomy manifolds.       Particularly convinient compactifications of 10-dimensional string theories, such as Type HE, are on $SU(3)$-holonomy Calabi-Yau manifolds.      Of course, it's not necessary; e.g. if the world happens to be something with $\mathcal N=2$ supersymmetry, as opposed to                           $\mathcal N=1$.             


  Why are there so many 'solutions'?  


Because there are lots of these manifolds!       


  I thought string theory was supposed to be finite, why do perturbative
  series still diverge?  


Uh... Yes. But it's renormaliable. And there are non-peturbative definitions in AdS spacetime.

  'solutions'?  Will experimental techniques be able to pinpoint a
  solution within present day string theorists' life      times too? If
  not, how long will it take before we can experimentally probe these

32,What are the benefits of owning a physical book?,"I have seen this question about updates of the D&amp;D 4th Edition books, and it got me thinking.
Since I got my Kindle I have not read a single paper novel; they have fewer drawbacks compared to digital copies than rpg rulebooks.


Dead-tree types have some benefits like looking good on a bookshelf, but any ebook reader weighs less with 100 novels than the usual hard-cover book. 
If you want to look for the damage of Ares Alpha, even with a half-decent tablet it takes less than 2 seconds.  
Digital copies do not get worn, they never get unwanted earmarks, but you can bookmark them.
Rulebooks do get updates, and unless you are willing to take a pen to your book, your hard copies will never contain them. The pdfs can be edited and resent to the buyers. 
Even better is the WotC approach with the DDI, you can look up any monster or item or (almost any) rule, in the most recent form, for 3 years at the cost of seven books. 


I think this is the way to go, even considering the horribly slow character builder. Although I must admit good illustration can help build the athmosphere.

So what am I missing? Why are people buying rpg rulebooks in paper format? Why are books even published, I do not need to know if feats are supposed to be on the right page and skills on the left, I just want a list of them, filterable any way I want. 

Is this just a necessary part of earning money? I understand that pdfs are copied illegally, but the Compendium is not. 
",András,https://rpg.stackexchange.com/users/9552,"As others have said - there's definitely something to be said about tactile navigation. 

While digital formats (assuming they're text-parseable) can be searched, if you don't know the specific spelling or the specific term, they can be difficult to parse by hand. Quadruply so if the publisher did not provide bookmarks to the different chapters. (Which is really annoying, imo.)

By contrast, with a physical copy, you can pick up a general sense of where the desired content is physically located fairly quickly. For example: Combat Rules are towards the middle. Spell lists are towards the end. Character classes are near the beginning. The more familiar one is with the book, the quicker this is to process (and more accurate one tends to get).

Additionally - I stare at a digital monitor all day at work; then for most of the evening. So if I actually have to read something, I'll opt for ink on paper, just to save my eyes that itty little bit. :)

38,Why is the potential function defined differently in physics and calculus?,"I am very familiar with the concept of a potential function, and potential energy, from calculus-based physics.

For instance, if we have the familiar force field $\mathbf{F} = -mg \,\mathbf{j}$, then a potential function is given by $U = mgy + C$. (Since potential energy is relative, we have an infinite number of potential functions.)

Notice that the gradient of the potential function is the negative of the force field: $$\nabla U = \nabla(mgy + C) = mg \,\mathbf{j} = -\mathbf{F}.$$

That was perfectly fine with me. But now in vector calculus, I am reading that the potential function $f$ of a vector function $\mathbf{F}$ is such that $\nabla f = \mathbf{F}$. A negative sign appears to have been lost when migrating from physics to calculus.

It seems confusing to call $f$ a ""potential function"", since it cannot be interpreted as potential energy in the real world. So why is the calculus nomenclature as it is (i.e., why not call this something else and then say the potential function is the negative of it)?
",Radon Rosborough,https://math.stackexchange.com/users/160658,"Recall where the negative sign comes from in physics -- it is simply due to your coordinate system and point of view. The difference is analogous to the difference between work done by gravity and work done on gravity.

41,"Relationship between user story, feature, and epic?","As someone whose still new to agile, I'm not sure I completely understand the relationship or difference between a user story, feature, and epic.

According to this question, a feature is a collection of stories.  One of the answers suggest that a feature is actually an epic.  

So are features and epics considered the same thing, which is basically a collection of related user stories?

Our project manager insists that there's a hierarchical structure:

Epic -> Features -> User stories

... basically all user stories must fall within this structure.  Therefore all user stories must fall under an umbrella feature and all features must fall under an epic.

To me, that sounds awkward.  Can someone please clarify how user stories, features, and epics are related?  Or is there an article that clearly outlines the differences?
",nivlam,https://programmers.stackexchange.com/users/45,"I caution you against applying too rigid a hierarchy to these terms.  We tried to do that in my previous job.  Twice.  Both attempts were different and both times we found we had unnecessarily limited ourselves.  The only constant was the definition of a User Story.  From a planning perspective, a story is the basic building block of a project.  The larger terms (epic, feature, etc.) are effectively just tags.  Tags are an easy way to allow a story to exist as part of multiple Epics and multiple Features at the same time.  It's not worth the mental effort to be more strict than that.

47,How do different tissue culture matrices affect background in fluorescent microscopy?,"In response to my previous question, I've been reading up a little bit on poly-D-lysine, Collagen I, Collagen IV, laminin, and other tissue culture coatings that promote cell adhesion. I've always assumed that anything other than standard TC-treated plastic or glass would significantly increase background, but perhaps my views on background fluorescence are a little outdated. Does anybody have experience with these in a fluorescent microscopy/high-throughput screening environment?

Specifically in my case, I'm looking at endocytosis and trafficking of a labeled protein into the lysosome. I'm labeling the protein with the pH-dependent dye pHrodoTM from Molecular Probes, which supposedly has very little fluorescence at neutral pH, but becomes very bright as the pH drops when endocytic vesicles become lysosomes. This theoretically means that a final wash step is not needed, but with a matrix coating on the plates I'm worried about background.

So, what is the current thinking as far as background fluorescence of the various TC matrices is concerned? Does the background come from the matrix itself, or by the fluorescent dye becoming adsorbed to it? Is it wavelength-dependent? Fortunately I may not be stuck with my poorly-adhering cells, and I may not need supplemental matrix at all in the end, but I still want a better understanding of how it works.

First, you should definitely read over the Wordpress FAQ for dealing with a hacked site.

Common entry points for gaining the ""access"" required to pull the injection off are outdated themes and/or plugins. It's best to run production servers with only the one active theme on the server, as well as removing unused plugins and replacing outdated active plugins.

There are a few scripts out there that you can upload to your server to help you find infected files so you can replace, clean or delete them. (Links listed below)

After I had installed most of the regular Windows applications I was using in Windows 7, I started on a getting-acquainted tour of the new OS and its ""ModernUI""apps.

The generic file type icons displayed in the Photos app really puzzled me, but a lot of Internet searching finally led to the solution: any installation of a recent version of the open source office suite ""LibreOffice"" changes the Windows registry of common graphics file types in an undesirable way, so that they are treated as a document rather than a picture.

There is a very long thread about the problems and solutions at http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows8_1-pictures/windows-81-photos-app-does-not-show-any-photos/5b1740bc-d87d-4d07-afe5-c1a60cdecd55?page=6&amp;msgId=9cdf0542-aab0-4a0b-85aa-e9f6d40b64fc

The simplest solution presented was a registry file which has to be reapplied every time LibreOffice is upgraded. The file must contain the following text and be named with a .reg suffix, then double click on it to load it into the registry. You may have to log out and back in, or even restart the computer--I can't remember which I did to get it to work.

",Bluefire,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/15851,"This is not an answer to your question but rather, additional information that may (or may not) be helpful in thinking about this kind of problem.

When I teach introductory circuit classes, I always emphasize the notion of duality which, when mastered, can give you deep insight into many fundamental ""rules"" of circuit analysis.

The idea is that if you know the answer for, say, a series circuit, you can take the dual of the result and get a correct answer for a seemingly very different problem.

So, here is short list of circuit duals:


  Voltage - Current
  
  Resistance - Conductance
  
  Inductance - Capacitance
  
  Impedance - Admittance
  
  Series - Parallel
  
  Thevenin - Norton


There are others but these will do most of the time.

Ohm's law is usually written as:

\$V = I R \$

To take the dual, replace all the variables in the above equation with their duals:

The dual of Ohm's Law:

\$I = VG \$

where \$G = \dfrac{1}{R} \$

Recall that for resistors in series, resistances add, so that the equivalent resistance is just the sum.

Consider the dual of this, conductances in parallel.

From the principle of duality, parallel conductances add just as series resistances.  So, if you have 3 conductances in parallel, the equivalent conductance is:

\$G_{eq} = G_1 + G_2 + G_3 \$

Now, convert back to resistance:

\$R_{eq} = \dfrac{1}{G_{eq}} = \dfrac{1}{G_1 + G_2 + G_3} = \dfrac{1}{\frac{1}{R_1}+\frac{1}{R_2} +\frac{1}{R_3}}\$

In other words, the equivalent resistance of \$n\$ parallel resistors is the reciprocal of the sum of the reciprocals.

This is the origin of your first formula.

",Anil Vaitla,https://stackoverflow.com/users/815977,"I think you need to read about projects and solutions: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee817674.aspx

And after that it all becomes more clear: Have one solution, inside of that solution create a project for your application and a project for your unit-tests. In test-project add reference to the testing framework of your choice and a reference to your application-project. 

This way your application does not know about your tests and compiled into one assembly. At the same time your tests depend on your application, but compiled into another assembly, which can be used by your test-runner GUI/CI or whatever else you use.

And to answer your next question, for test-project you need to choose project type of ""Library"" (console application will work as well if you like)

IDE is ""Integrated Device Electronics"" - also known as ""ATA"" or ""ATAPI"" (ATA Peripheral Interface).

SATA is ""Serial ATA"" - the same ATA protocol but serial instead of parallel.

USB is a serial communications bus which can communicate with any number of devices, not just hard drives and other storage devices.  It speaks a completely different protocol to the ATA family.

I've searched around but I can't find any information on how to implement a Taylor window. Any information on taylor window or suggestions on fixing this issue of edge discontinuities would be very appreciated.
",Thinium,https://dsp.stackexchange.com/users/16093,"A little Googling came up with this reference, which indicates that the impulse response for a Taylor window is:

$$
h[n] = 1 + 2 \sum_{m=1}^{\tilde{n}-1} F_m \cos\left(\frac{2\pi m}{N} \left(n-\frac{N}{2}+\frac{1}{2}\right)\right)
$$

$\tilde{n}$ is a parameter for controlling how many equal-height sidelobes there are in the window. $F_m$ is a parameter that is related to the maximum sidelobe height; the references given in Matt L's answer give more detail on how it is calculated.

65,Silverlight: Returning value from synchronous method using Rx,"I am writing a simple Silverlight application and WCF Service.
I want to create a synchronous method that return a value.
The method itself, call an asynchronous method from WCF Services. After I call asynchronous method, I want to get it value, and return to sender.
I hear that Rx can solve this kind of problem.

This is my code :

    private void btnCreate_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
    {
        string myResult = getMyBook(txtBookName.Text);
        MessageBox.Show(""Result\n"" + myResult);
        // myResult will be use for another purpose here..
    }

    // I want this method can be called anywhere, as long as the caller still in the same namespace.
    public string getMyBook(string bookName)
    {
        Servo.ServoClient svc = new ServoClient();
        string returnValue = """";

        var o = Observable.FromEventPattern&lt;GetBookCompletedEventArgs&gt;(svc, ""GetBookCompleted"");
        o.Subscribe(
            b =&gt; returnValue = b.EventArgs.Result
            );

        svc.GetBookAsync(bookName);
        return returnValue;
    }


When I click btnCreate, myResult variable still empty. Is that something wrong with my code? Or maybe I am just don't understand with Rx concept? I am new to Rx.

My goal is : I need to get the result (myResult variable) from asynchronous method, and then used in later code.
",Trom,https://stackoverflow.com/users/1219992,"Remember that GetBookAsync returns immediately, and will return the value stored in returnvalue. When the data arrives returnvalue will be out of scope, and by then btnCreate will have finished.

U could use await on the GetBookAsync, so that it will wait for the data to arrive before continuing.  Don't forget that would mean u also need the async on the method.

Not a great example or use of either RX or await, but trying is how we learn!

71,Get term weight in node object for ordering with EntityFieldQuery,"Is it posiible to expose taxonomy term weight in node object ?

I need to sort nodes using EntityFieldQuery by term reference field, but weight is not exposed to node object so i can say for example 

-&gt;fieldOrderBy('field_custom_terms', 'weight', 'ASC');


and sort nodes by weight of terms.
",NenadP,https://drupal.stackexchange.com/users/5970,"No, this is not possible. You can only order on actual field values, the term weight would require a JOIN to a non-field table and EFQ is not capable of doing that.

You will have to create a manual SQL query to do this. Note that Drupal by default maintains the node &lt;-> term associations in the taxonomy_index table, that one is easier and more reliable to query than a field data table.

74,Symfony 2 and Twig custom error page,"I give up.

The problem is with the overrided Twig 404 template. It is overrided in a default way by creating an error404.html.twig under the /app/Resources/TwigBundle/views directory.

The template itself does not contain any irregular or complex logic: just a layout with some translated text (|trans) and a menu with several links.

The problem is, that I can't get app.user object (returned as NULL) or current app.request.locale (always returned as default locale) inside this template.

I have even tried to override the twig exception controller and dump a current locale (Request::getLocale()) or get user - the results are the same - default locale and NULL for user.

Then I decided to dig deeper and found a dozens of listeners (locale listeners, exception liteners, ...) and tried to debug/fix/test there, but I didn't proceed any further.

By the way, I have overrided the 500 error page too, and everything is fine there. Well I guess that when 500 error (exception) is thrown, the symfony has already set up user/locale/etc, because it already has got to the target (controller/action) and other listeners been already executed. But 404 error (NotFoundHttpException) is being thrown BEFORE Symfony targets the action...

Some words about project: symfony 2.4.8, doctrine, Gedmo extensions/stof bundle, JMS i18n routing bundle.

Symfony version: v2.4.8
JMS I18n Routing bundle: 1.1.1

Appreciate your help.
",Dmitry,https://stackoverflow.com/users/629899,"That's the way I do it (at least for 404 templates):

In app/config/routing.yml append:

    defaults: { _controller: ACMEDemoBundle:Default:wrongRoute}
    requirements:

The Controller:

namespace ACME\DemoBundle\Controller;

use Symfony\Bundle\FrameworkBundle\Controller\Controller;
use Symfony\Component\HttpKernel\Exception\NotFoundHttpException;
